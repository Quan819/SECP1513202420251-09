# Reflection for each assignment & project
 - Assignment 1

Through this assignment, I learned how to make posters and gained an understanding of the role of ICT in the software engineering field of AirAsia. To create an efficient working environment, the company promotes a "no Sir" culture and a work - from - home model, both of which rely on the support of ICT tools. By using ICT, the company organizes various activities such as daily stand - up meetings and on - boarding training to facilitate communication among employees.

 - Assignment 2

Through this assignment, I learned how to edit videos and gained a deeper understanding of the in - depth computer - related operations of the school. I was amazed by the rapid development of technology when I saw the smart whiteboard in the classroom. I hope that smart whiteboards can be used in daily teaching soon. I would like to express my gratitude to every teacher at UTM Digital for their silent dedication to providing us with a good learning environment.

 - Assignment3

The Design Thinking project was an enriching experience that honed my problem - solving and teamwork skills. It underscored the power of empathy, pushing me to design solutions that meet users' needs.

During the process, from brainstorming to prototyping, I witnessed the importance of creativity, adaptability, and collaboration. Team members shared diverse ideas and adjusted plans based on new insights. The iterative design process taught me that improvement is ongoing. Each iteration refined our ideas and made our solution better.

This project has equipped me with crucial skills for future challenges. It has also deepened my understanding of user - centered design. I'm thankful for this experience and excited to apply what I've learned in the future.
